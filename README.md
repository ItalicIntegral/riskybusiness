## About Me
### I suck at programming.

I write SQL, and a little VBA. I look for fraud, risk, data, and errors in business system transactions. I see the results of my co-workers decisions. I don't understand the reasoning for some decisions because I am not employed for my expertise in their respective fields.

I'm not a lawyer.
I'm not an insurance specialist.
I'm not a risk assessment specialist.
I'm not a software developer.
I'm not a computer sciences specialist.
I'm not an asset protection specialist.
I'm not trained in business.
I'm not an accountant.
I'm not a business intelligence specialist.
I'm not a supply chain specialist.
I'm not a sales specialist.
I'm not a marketting specialist.

But I have picked up a little over the years.

## A Silly Idea
I find business systems facinating. I have found so many issues within them by crawling their tables in my work. I sometimes have the silly idea that I could write one.

I don't know how.

I don't have a CS degree. I am a Mechanical Engineering Technologist that landed an Analyst position due to lack of work in oilfield equipment design.
